//     This could be some nodes of a way. There exist ways for which some nodes have
//     just a single delete version, e.g. way 159081205, node 376130526
//   - data pre element versioning: pre-2012(?) data versions were not kept, so
//     for old ways there many be no information about some nodes. For example,
//     a node may be updated after a way and there is no way to get the original
//     version of the node and way.
//   - bad editors: sometimes a node is edited 7 times in a single changeset
//     and version 5 is a delete. See node 321452894, part of way 28831147.
