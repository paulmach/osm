# osm [![CI](https://github.com/paulmach/osm/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paulmach/osm/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+event%3Apush) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/paulmach/osm)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/paulmach/osm) [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/paulmach/osm.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/paulmach/osm)

This package is a general purpose library for reading, writing and working
with [OpenStreetMap](https://osm.org) data in Go (golang). It has the ability to:

-   read/write [OSM XML](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML)
-   read/write [OSM JSON](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_JSON),
    a format returned by the Overpass API.
-   efficiently parse [OSM PBF](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format) data files available at
    [planet.osm.org](https://planet.osm.org/)

Made available by the package are the following types:

-   Node
-   Way
-   Relation
-   Changeset
-   Note
-   User

And the following “container” types:

-   OSM - container returned via API
-   Change - used by the replication API
-   Diff - corresponds to [Overpass Augmented Diffs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Augmented_Diffs)

## List of sub-package utilities

-   [`annotate`](annotate) - adds lon/lat, version, changeset and orientation data to way and relation members
-   [`osmapi`](osmapi) - supports all the v0.6 read/data endpoints
-   [`osmgeojson`](osmgeojson) - OSM to GeoJSON conversion compatible with [osmtogeojson](https://github.com/tyrasd/osmtogeojson)
-   [`osmpbf`](osmpbf) - stream processing of `*.osm.pbf` files
-   [`osmxml`](osmxml) - stream processing of `*.osm` xml files
-   [`replication`](replication) - fetch replication state and change files

## Concepts

This package refers to the core OSM data types as **Objects**. The Node, Way,
Relation, Changeset, Note and User types implement the `osm.Object` interface
and can be referenced using the `osm.ObjectID` type. As a result it is possible
to have a slice of `[]osm.Object` that contains nodes, changesets and users.

Individual versions of the core OSM Map Data types are referred to as **Elements**
and the set of versions for a give Node, Way or Relation is referred to as a
**Feature**. For example, an `osm.ElementID` could refer to "Node with id 10 and
version 3" and the `osm.FeatureID` would refer to "all versions of node with id 10."
Put another way, features represent a road and how it's changed over time and an
element is a specific version of that feature.

A number of helper methods are provided for dealing with features and elements.
The idea is to make it easy to work with a Way and its member nodes, for example.

## Scanning large data files

For small data it is possible to use the `encoding/xml` package in the
Go standard library to marshal/unmarshal the data. This is typically done using the
`osm.OSM` or `osm.Change` "container" structs.

For large data the package defines the `Scanner` interface implemented in both the [osmxml](osmxml)
and [osmpbf](osmpbf) sub-packages.

```go
type osm.Scanner interface {
	Scan() bool
	Object() osm.Object
	Err() error
	Close() error
}
```

This interface is designed to mimic the [bufio.Scanner](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Scanner)
interface found in the Go standard library.

Example usage:

```go
f, err := os.Open("./delaware-latest.osm.pbf")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
defer f.Close()

scanner := osmpbf.New(context.Background(), f, 3)
defer scanner.Close()

for scanner.Scan() {
	o := scanner.Object()
	// do something
}

scanErr := scanner.Err()
if scanErr != nil {
	panic(scanErr)
}
```

**Note:** Scanners are **not** safe for parallel use. One should feed the
objects into a channel and have workers read from that.

## Working with JSON

This library supports reading and writing [OSM JSON](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_JSON).
This format is returned by the Overpass API and can be optionally returned by the
[OSM API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6#JSON_Format).

If performance is important, this library supports third party "encoding/json" replacements
such as [github.com/json-iterator/go](https://github.com/json-iterator/go).

They can be enabled with something like this:

```go
import (
  jsoniter "github.com/json-iterator/go"
  "github.com/paulmach/osm"
)

var c = jsoniter.Config{
  EscapeHTML:              true,
  SortMapKeys:             false,
  MarshalFloatWith6Digits: true,
}.Froze()

osmm.CustomJSONMarshaler = c
osm.CustomJSONUnmarshaler = c
```

The above change can have dramatic performance implications, see the benchmarks below
on a large OSM Change object.

```

BenchmarkChange_UnmarshalJSON-12     287707        317723        +10.43%
```

## CGO and zlib

OSM PBF data comes in blocks, each block is zlib compressed. Decompressing this
data takes about 33% of the total read time. [4kills/go-libdeflate](https://github.com/4kills/go-libdeflate) is
used to speed up decompressing.
See [osmpbf/README.md](osmpbf#using-libdeflate-for-decompression) for more details.

As a result, a C compiler is necessary to install this module. On macOS this may require
installing pkg-config using something like `brew install pkg-config`

CGO can be disabled at build time using the `CGO_ENABLED` ENV variable.
For example, `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build`. The code will fallback to the stdlib implementation of zlib.
